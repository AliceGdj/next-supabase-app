# Next Supabase Project 

This is a small Next.js project to get hands on the App Router and experiment with the Supabase Postgres infrastucture.

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result and play around.
